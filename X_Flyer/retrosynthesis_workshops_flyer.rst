Overview
============

UA Libraries will be hosting a workshop series on open-source computer assisted retrosynthesis workflows. These workshops will use python programming
and cheminformatics techniques for predicting retrosynthesis. Why attend?

- Enhance your chemical synthesis literature searching skills
- Learn how to use the cheminformatics toolkit, RDKit, for working with digital molecules and reactions
- Work through several open-source retrosynthesis workflows, including software and methods published by scientists at **MIT, AstraZeneca, and Eli Lilly**

.. note::

   **Registration Links:** Registration is required -- morning sessions: `ua.libcal.com/calendar/instruction/morning_retro`_ ; afternoon sessions: `ua.libcal.com/calendar/instruction/afternoon_retro`_

   **Location**: Rodgers Library Scholars' Station.

   **Time and Duration**: All workshops will be offered twice on the date scheduled in order to accommodate schedules (see below). The morning session will start at **10:00 AM** and the afternoon session will start at **3:30 PM**; expected durations are about 1 hour.

   **Technology**: We recommend bringing your own laptop; if you are using Windows, we recommend installing Windows Subsystem for Linux.

   **Additional Information:** Prior programming experience is beneficial but not necessary. You will still learn how to get started, even if you don't fully understand all the code during the workshops.

   **Reusue and sharing:** Code presented during the workshops is available here: `github.com/ualibweb/retrosynthesis`_

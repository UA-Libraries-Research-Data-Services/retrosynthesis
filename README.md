## How to Run the Notebooks

All Jupyter notebooks were developed locally on Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. The notebooks have only been tested on Linux. We think the code should also work on Mac OS, but not on Windows as the multiprocessing code would be different on Windows. We recommend running the notebooks locally using Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux.

Alternatively, if you have a GitHub account, [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces), an online computational environment, is another option to run these retrosynthesis tutorials. **Please note that you may need to adjust your [Codespaces billing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces) settings and monitor useage to avoid unwanted charges.** There are some free compute hours for each user; more resources are available for a fee. You might also be able to run the notebooks on Google Colab, but you would need to create your own conda and development environments first.

Our initial testing with GitHub Codespaces (VS Code for the Web) suggests that you will need to use at least a 4 core machine for the AiZynthFinder and Similarity-based retrosynthesis workshops. To run the notebooks in Codespaces:

1. On the repository main page, click `code > codespaces > New with options`. Select `Machine type > 4-core > Create codespace`
2. Then, install the needed extensions, including the `Python` and `Jupyter` extensions made by Microsoft.
3. Open a terminal in the codespace, and make the setup script executable: `chmod +x setup.sh`
4. Run the setup script with `./setup.sh`. This will take about 15 minutes and will install system dependencies, download some datasets, create conda environments: `retro_rdkit_env`, `retro_aizynth_env`, and `retro_sim_env`, and download/build the LillyMol C++ software.
5. Verify the conda environments were installed by running `conda info --envs`. Individual packages can be shown with `conda list --name myenv`
6. Verify the LillyMol software works: `cd LillyMol-6-cmake/src/build/build`, then try one of the programs: `./retrosynthesis`. That should bring up a help file.
7. Now, you should be able to run all of the notebooks, be sure to select the appropiate conda environment kernel (see notebook text).
8. Stop the codespace. When finished working, navigate back to the repository main page, and click `code > codespaces (the specific one) > Stop codespace`. You can monitor your useage and billing in your GitHub Settings.

## Notes

> [!CAUTION]
> Retrosynthesis Workshop and Materials Disclaimer

The intention of these retrosynthesis workshops and materials is to provide introductory computer-based tutorials for learning about published open-source retrosynthetic techniques. These tutorials are designed to enhance end-user chemical information discovery strategies. However, end-users should be aware of the following important considerations:

**Training Data:** The retrosynthetic prediction techniques in the tutorials use publicly available reaction data (and/or computer models derived from this data) from U.S. patents for training purposes.

**Intellectual Property:** Due to the use of patent reaction data, it may be possible that predicted reaction pathways can match or be similar to those reported in patents. Patents are a form of intellectual property, and specific synthetic pathways and compounds may be protected by law [1,2].

**Practical Application:** While the techniques taught in these workshop materials can computationally predict synthetic routes, attempting to replicate or use these routes in a laboratory setting would require additional research such as appropiate reaction conditions and safety considerations. Moreover, replication of certain predicted routes may infringe on existing patents. Always verify the suitability and legal status of the methods and compounds before any practical application.

**Alternative Data Sources:** Although patent reaction data is widely used in cheminformatics for reaction prediction due to its availability, it is possible to use non-patent reaction data for these tutorials such as those extracted from journal articles, to explore synthetic pathways that may not be covered by patents.

In summary, please respect intellectual property laws and understand that the provided examples are for educational computer-based learning purposes. Always consult with legal experts if you plan to apply these techniques in your research.
